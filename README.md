# Weather Web App

A simple weather web application that allows users to check the current weather based on their location or by searching for a specific city. The app fetches weather data from a weather API and displays it in an easy-to-understand format.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: View the current weather, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- **City Search**: Search weather for any city around the world.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Weather Data**: The weather data is updated in real-time using the API.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface with a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: To handle dynamic interactions and API requests.
- **Weather API**: The app uses a weather API to fetch real-time weather data.
